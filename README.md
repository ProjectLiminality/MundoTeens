# Mundo Teens Project

A hands-on educational project where children design and build a complete three-dimensional festival/theme park model from scratch. This project combines creativity, engineering, science, and mathematics through practical, engaging activities.

## Project Overview

Based on concepts from [Daydream Believers](https://daydreambelievers.co.uk), this project challenges students to envision, plan, and construct a scaled physical model featuring various attractions, entertainment areas, and interactive elements. The end result is a fully functional 3D model that incorporates multiple learning disciplines.

## Core Learning Objectives

- **Spatial Design & Architecture**: Creating layouts and structures
- **Scale & Proportion**: Understanding how size relationships work in 3D space
- **Engineering & Mechanics**: Building moving parts and functional components
- **Science & Chemistry**: Exploring electricity and chemical reactions
- **Art & Design**: Creating visual elements and aesthetics
- **Project Management**: Coordinating multiple interconnected sub-projects

## Sub-Projects

### 1. Mascot Design & 3D Printing
**Status**: In Progress
- Children have created initial mascot drawings
- AI refinement completed for proper character designs
- **Next Steps**:
  - Generate 3D models using AI-to-3D tools
  - 3D print mascot figures
  - Hand-paint finished models for placement throughout the park

### 2. Motorized Ferris Wheel
**Status**: Planning
- **Motor System**: LEGO motor (plug-and-play, no soldering required)
- **Construction**: Combination of custom-built and 3D-printed components
- **Learning Focus**: Mechanical engineering, gear systems, rotational motion
- **Scale Consideration**: Will serve as the primary scale-determining element

### 3. Potato Battery LED Lighting
**Status**: Concept
- LED light chains powered by potato batteries
- **Learning Focus**: Chemistry, electricity, circuit basics
- **Application**: Ambient lighting throughout the model

### 4. Zipline/Gondola Transport System
**Status**: Concept
- Hanging transport system connecting different areas of the park
- **Learning Focus**: Physics of motion, tension, and gravity

## General Project Components

### Landscape Design
- **Terrain Modeling**: Multi-level landscape using stackable, cuttable materials
- **Contour Learning**: Students discover topographical mapping through hands-on terrain creation
- **Scale Integration**: Landscape design must accommodate all sub-project elements

### Scale Determination
- **Primary Constraint**: Table dimensions determine maximum model size
- **Scale Logic**: Ferris wheel (largest element) determines overall project scale
- **Learning Goal**: Students discover that the largest component drives scale decisions

### Base Infrastructure
- **Platform**: Dedicated table serving as the foundation
- **Layout Planning**: Strategic placement of all sub-components
- **Accessibility**: Design considerations for viewing and interaction

## Project Philosophy

This project emphasizes learning through discovery rather than instruction. Students are guided to make key insights themselves, such as understanding how the largest element (ferris wheel) naturally determines the scale constraints for the entire model.

## Future Development

As the project evolves, additional sub-components may be identified and separated into their own focused learning modules. The modular approach allows for flexible expansion while maintaining clear learning objectives for each element.
